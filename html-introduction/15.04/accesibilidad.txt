Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. 
Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the <button> element (and not a <div> element).

Headings Are Important
Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags

Alternative Text
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
The value of the alt attribute should describe the image

Declare the Language
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
The following example specifies English as the language

Use Clear Language
Always use a clear language, that is easy to understand. Also try to avoid characters that cannot be read clearly by a screen reader. For example:
Keep sentences as short as possible
Avoid dashes. Instead of writing 1-3, write 1 to 3
Avoid abbreviations. Instead of writing Feb, write February
Avoid slang words

Create Good Link Text
A link text should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link.

The title Attribute
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element.
The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
The title attribute can be used on any HTML element (it will validate on any HTML element. However, it is not necessarily useful).
